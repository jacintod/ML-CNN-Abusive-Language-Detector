# ML-CNN-Abusive-Language-Detector
This notebook forms part of the SET11121 / SET11521 / SET11821 - Data Wrangling assignment, to develop and evaluate a abusive language detection model for a given dataset.

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network using Word2Vec as the word embedding layer. 

The CNN architecture chosen is described in more detail in submission - Part B literture.

The notebook contains some source code which has been adapted and modified to meet the needs of model. Source code credit is provided where applicable, and references provided at the end of the notebook. 

The libraries used are NLTK, Gensim, Keras, Numpy, Pandas and a pre-trained Google News corpus (3 billion running words) word vector model containing 3 million 300-dimension English word vectors.
